## Tutorial

- Download the [Github Desktop App here](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Open it
- Sign up or Sign in
- Create a new repository on your hard drive
![img](img/tutorial-1.png)
- Name the repository `my-dogs-website` and save it to a `Local Path` that you won't forget. Click `Create Repository`
![img](img/tutorial-2.png)
- At this point, you have an empty repository on your hard drive (basically, just an empty folder). Now you need to put something in it.
- I recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Now you can edit your empty repository with Visual Studio Code
![img](img/tutorial-3.png)
- Here is what your empty reposity looks like in Visual Studio Code

- Click the `New File` button to create your website
![img](img/tutorial-5.png)
- Name the file `index.html`
![img](img/tutorial-6.png)
- Inside the editor window, type anything. I added `hello from my dog`

- Go back to your Github Desktop app. It should notice the changes you made to your repository.
- Click `Commit to main`

- "Commit to main" just updates your repository locally on your hard drive. You need to click `Publish Repository` to get it to sync with the Github on the internet
![img](img/tutorial-9.png)
- Since this is the first publish, it will ask you what you want to name the repository on Github. Name it `my-dogs-website` and click `Publish Repository`
![img](img/tutorial-10.png)
- Now you can go into Github and see your code in the repository on the Github servers
![img](img/tutorial-11.png)
- Now, the fun part. Lets get your website live on the internet. We're going to use Netlify for this.
- Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and click `Sign up`.
![img](img/tutorial-12.png)
- (Since I'm already signed up, I don't have any screenshots for the sign up process. Probably you're going to Authenticate with Github)
- Once you're signed in and on the Netlify dashboard, click `New site from Git`
![img](img/tutorial-13.png)
- On the next page, click `Github`
![img](img/tutorial-14.png)
- All your repositories should be listed. If you don't see `my-dogs-website` click on the link on the bottom to reconfigure permissions
![img](img/tutorial-15.png)
- When you reconfigure your permissions, you'll "install netlify" into your Github account
![img](img/tutorial-16.png)
- On the next screen, scroll down
![img](img/tutorial-17.png)
- Scroll down to the `Repository access` page. You can click `All Repositories` for now. If you're paranoid and only want _some_ repositories shared, you can click `Only select repositories` then configure which repositories. Then click `Save` at the bottom
![img](img/tutorial-18.png)
- Now when you go back to the original Netlify page to create a new site, you should see `my-dogs-website`. Click it.
![img](img/tutorial-19.png)
- On the last page of the Netlify process, you don't need to configure anything fancy. Just click `Deploy site` on the bottom
![img](img/tutorial-20.png)
- Now, you have a dashboard with your new site.
- At the top of this dashboard, you should see `Site deploy in progress`. Give it a minute to finish.
![img](img/tutorial-21.png)
- Refresh the page
- Now you should see a URL where your website is deployed. Click it to see your website live on the internet.
![img](img/tutorial-22.png)
- Yay! Your website is live on the internet!
